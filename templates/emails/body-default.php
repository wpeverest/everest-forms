 * Email Body

 * This is used with the {all_fields} smart tag.
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/everest-forms/emails/body-default.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion Everest Forms will need to update template files and you
 * and you (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @see     https://docs.everestforms.net/
 * @package EverestForms/Templates
 * @version 1.2.0
