# We use codeowners to help keep teams in the loop on changes to code
# they typically work on. Even though this file is called CODEOWNERS,
# we don't really want to enforce or imply ownership of code, just interest.
#
# Anyone can work on anything.
#
# Prefer associating a "team" with a path rather than an individual. That allows individuals to
# move around without having to continually update this file.
#
# See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_owners.html for details on the format of this file
